# YouTube ReVanced for Android 6.0-7.1
An unofficial ReVanced Extended for YouTube 17.34.36.  
Based on inotia00's ReVanced Extended [v2.160.1](https://github.com/inotia00/revanced-patches/releases/tag/v2.160.1)

## How to patch
See [[How to build]](https://github.com/kitadai31/revanced-patches/wiki/How-to-build) page in documentations.

Other informations are also avalable on [[documentations]](https://github.com/kitadai31/revanced-patches-android6-7/wiki) (GitHub Wiki).

## Overview
The last YouTube app available on Android 6 or 7 is **17.34.36**, but the latest ReVanced and ReVanced Extended are not compatible with 17.34.36.

However, until ReVanced Extended **v2.160.1**, most of patches worked properly, although not officially supported.

So I forked RVX 2.160.1 and released this unofficial (yet another) ReVanced Patches for YouTube 17.34.36.  
I fixed some issues in 2.160.1 and backported some features (**including protobuf-spoof**) from newer version.

Furthermore, I have successfully made ReVanced Manager work on A6-7.  
So you can build it as easily as regular ReVanced and without Termux!

> However, due to stability and performance issues, if you have another newer device, you may want to use it.
>
> For this "revanced-patches-android6-7" I have checked that the patch completes successfully on my main smartphone (Snapdragon 410, 2GB RAM, Android 7.1.1), but it took **45 minutes** to complete.

## Todo
~~I would like to quit developing based on 2.160.1 and remake it based on the latest RVX. (for well maintainabilityüîß, updated translationüåç and new features‚ú®)~~ it's difficult for me

## I have skill issue...
Embarrassingly, I'm not very familiar with reverse engineering and also programming. (But I can read a little smali :D )  
So I can not create new patches by myself. All my modifying are merely copy and paste.

If anyone else is interested in developing a ReVanced Patches for YouTube 17.34.36 besides me, please don't hesitate to release it!  
If a more excellent ReVanced Patches for YouTube 17.34.36 is emerged, I will immediately stop releasing my one and introduce yours!

Also all contributions are welcomed!
